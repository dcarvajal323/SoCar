(4/22/2021, 3:00PM) The SoCar Vivado project is basically just a copy of the PCam5 demo. We need to modify the PWM control IP from homework 3 to only output one pwm signal instead of 4, and instead of outputting to an LED port, it needs to output to a regular I/O port. Once the new IP is made, we will need two of these modules added into the main block design. The I/O ports can be found in the same Master Constraints file that the LEDs are in. Any pin from the JE, JD, or JC ports would work fine. We also need to make sure the frequency of the output is 60Hz.
